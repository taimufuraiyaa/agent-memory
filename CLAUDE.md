# agent-memory — Project Instructions for AI Agents

## Rules (ENFORCED)
- Specs-first: follow `.kiro/specs/<feature>/requirements.md` → `design.md` → `tasks.md`.
- If no relevant spec exists for non-trivial work, create it before changing code.
- Mermaid: always quote node labels, e.g. `Node["Label (safe)"]`.
- Update spec task checkboxes in `.kiro/specs/**/tasks.md` when completing work.

---


## Specs-First (FORCED)
- For any non-trivial feature/bugfix, consult the relevant spec in `.kiro/specs/<feature>/` and derive the plan from `requirements.md` → `design.md` → `tasks.md`.
- If no relevant spec exists, create it (requirements first, then design, then tasks) before implementing code changes.
- If implementation maps to `.kiro/specs/**/tasks.md`, update the relevant checkbox items before finishing the work.

## Design Depth (FORCED)
- Write `design.md` and `tasks.md` as a Solution Architect: alternatives, trade-offs, risks, edge cases, data contracts, failure modes, performance/scaling, and rollout strategy.
- Do NOT include example code in `design.md`.

## Mermaid Safety (ENFORCED)
- For any Mermaid diagram, ALWAYS enclose node labels in double quotes.
  - Correct: `Node["Process (step 1)"]`
  - Incorrect: `Node[Process (step 1)]`

## Truthfulness (ENFORCED)
- Do not guess or fabricate details. If information is missing, explicitly say what's missing and then proceed by inspecting the repo.

## agent-memory (MANDATORY)

workspace: agent-memory

Always use `agent-memory` as the memory system:
- Before doing any self-research: run memory `search` first. Run task `recall` only when the task is about continuing previous work, or when search returns no useful / weak / insufficient results.
- After running search or recall: you MUST immediately submit a feedback score from 0 (useless) to 5 (extremely helpful) using command `agent-memory feedback --request-id <request_id> --score <0-5> --reason "<explanation>"`. You MUST score honestly and objectively based on the true usefulness of the retrieved memories (e.g., score 0 if retrieved memories were completely irrelevant or did not help, score 5 if they directly contained the solution or crucial context). Do not default to high scores. You MUST always provide a reason regardless of the score; if the score is below 4, you MUST provide a detailed explanation (the command will fail if reason is omitted for scores below 4).
- After learning durable new knowledge: write it to memory immediately.
- Be self-aware of reusable scripts, grep queries, or workflows: package them into custom skills under `.agents/skills/` (using `agent-memory distill` or manual packaging) for later reuse.
- When packaging or organizing custom agent skills (e.g. under `.agents/skills/`):
  - Do NOT use generic, numbered, or index-based filenames (like `part1.md`, `workflows_part1.md`).
  - Always use clear, descriptive, and meaningful names for all custom skill reference files (e.g., `db_performance.md`, `ui_fixes.md`) that represent their respective feature, domain, or component.
  - Limit every individual skill file's size strictly to a maximum of 12,000 characters. If a skill grows beyond this, partition it by domain/feature and place the detailed references into a `references/` subdirectory with descriptive, meaningful filenames.
- At the end of a session: store a short session summary via `session-end`.
